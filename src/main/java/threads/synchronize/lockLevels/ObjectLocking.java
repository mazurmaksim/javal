//        Synchronized statements are also useful for improving concurrency with fine-grained synchronization. Suppose,
//        for example, class MsLunch has two instance fields, c1 and c2, that are never used together.
//        All updates of these fields must be synchronized,
//        but there's no reason to prevent an update of c1 from being interleaved with an update of c2 â€” and
//        doing so reduces concurrency by creating unnecessary blocking. Instead of using synchronized methods or
//        otherwise using the lock associated with this, we create two objects solely to provide locks.
